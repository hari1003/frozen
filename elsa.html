<h2>Anna</h2>
<img src="anna.jpeg"width=400px; height= 400px;>
<p>Anna is the daughter of Agnarr and Iduna, younger sister of Elsa, and current queen of Arendelle. She was extremely close with Elsa, but an accident during their childhoods prompted their parents to separate them from each other and the outside world. During the long years that followed, Anna tried repeatedly to spend time with Elsa but to no avail. This isolated existence was made complete by the sudden deaths of Agnarr and Iduna, leaving Anna to truly alone.<br><br>

Despite the tragedies she endured, Anna was still hopeful for the future. When Elsa fled the kingdom due to the exposure of her ice magic, Anna took it upon herself to bring her sister back, regardless of the potential danger. After Anna inadvertently showed Elsa the key to controlling her powers, the rift between the two sisters was at long last healed.<br><br>

Three years later, Anna accompanied Elsa on her journey to the Enchanted Forest in search of a mysterious voice heard by her sister. Together, the sisters corrected the wrongs committed by their grandfather, saving both the Enchanted Forest and Arendelle. With Elsa deciding to remain in the forest Anna is later crowned queen of Arendelle, with Elsa believing her to be well suited to the role. Anna also accepts Kristoff's proposal to marry him.</p>
<h2>Kristoff</h2>
<img src="kristoff.jpeg"width=400px; height= 400px;>
<p>Kristoff was orphaned at a young age and placed in an orphanage thereafter. He was nevertheless too adventurous and free-spirited to be contained in such a facility; he spent a majority of his time sneaking out and exploring the surrounding wilderness. With a fascination of ice, Kristoff also occupied his time by tagging behind Arendelle's team of ice harvesters to observe their ethics in hopes of garnering their skill and eventually becoming an ice harvester himself.[4]

Kristoff is always accompanied by his reindeer, Sven — his pet, best friend, and business partner.The two met during Kristoff's childhood, wherein during which, he found and rescued the reindeer fawn.Since then, the two became inseparable and built a relationship akin to that of brothers.Kristoff's care for Sven was so great that he eventually began living by the philosophy that "reindeer are better than people", to which Sven would agree.<br> <br>Furthermore, although Sven cannot speak, both he and Kristoff have a mutual understanding of one another. So much that Kristoff has a habit to literally voice Sven's thoughts in a gruff, goofy, exaggerated tone.Sven doesn't seem to mind, and the voice-overs are surprisingly accurate.Interestingly, Kristoff uses this quirk to talk himself into doing the right thing, in times of uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Olaf</h2>
<img src="olaf.jpeg"width=400px; height= 400px;>
<p>Created from Elsa's magical powers, Olaf is by far the friendliest snowman in Arendelle. He is innocent, outgoing and loves all things summer. Olaf may be a bit naive, but his sincerity and good-natured temperament make him a true friend to Anna and Elsa.<br><br>Olaf was built on the night of the accident that would separate Elsa and Anna for thirteen years. At the time, Olaf was not yet sentient, and Elsa would simulate the snowman's actions and voice, creating his signature greeting: "Hi, I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs". Anna loved the snowman she had built with her sister, and the three of them skated inside the Great Hall, propelled by Elsa's magic. However, after Anna was struck by Elsa's magic, Olaf toppled as a result of ice spreading across the room.</p>
